# Multimodal-Educational-Assistant-with-real-time-QA-and-Dynamic-learning-support
AI-Enhanced Educational Assistant leverages 
advanced deep learning and natural language processing to create an 
interactive system capable of answering questions across various 
media formats, including PDFs, videos, audio files, images, and text 
documents. By utilizing the Gemini 1.5 Pro model for real-time 
inference, alongside technologies such as Spacy, T5, BERT, LSTM, 
and GenAI, the system summarizes key information and provides 
concise, contextually relevant answers. The tool includes a GPT-3.5 
Pro-powered Q&A chatbot, which maintains session history to offer 
personalized, continuous support throughout the learning journey. 
The assistant also provides session highlights, suggested resources, 
and enables dynamic interaction, addressing the need for smarter, 
multimodal educational tools. Streamlit is used to build a userfriendly interface, allowing seamless interaction with the system. 
This project aims to enhance the learning experience by integrating 
multiple media types, offering real-time responses, and providing 
context-aware support, making education more efficient, 
personalized, and accessible. Continuous improvements will be 
made based on user feedback to ensure its relevance and 
effectiveness.
