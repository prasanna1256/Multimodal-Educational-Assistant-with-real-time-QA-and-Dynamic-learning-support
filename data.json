The module is red and features various components, including a heat sink, integrated circuits, capacitors, and screw terminals for connections.\n\nThe labeled connections indicate how to interface the module with an Arduino microcontroller and two DC motors.\n\n* **Motor Connections:**  The module provides dedicated terminals for connecting two motors (labeled \"MOTOR 1\" and \"MOTOR 2\").  Each motor has two terminals for connecting the positive and negative leads.\n\n* **Power Supply:** The \"+ve terminal of battery\" connects to the power input for the motors.  This supplies the voltage that drives the motors.  The \"-ve terminal of battery\" is connected to both the Arduino's GND (ground) and the module's ground, completing the circuit.\n\n* **Arduino Control:** The module connects to the Arduino through several pins.\n\n    * **Direction Control:**  \"MOTOR 1 direction control\" and \"MOTOR 2 direction control\" are connected to digital pins on the Arduino. By changing the logic level (HIGH or LOW) on these pins, the Arduino can control the direction of rotation of each motor.\n    * **Speed Control:** \"MOTOR 2 speed control\" is connected to a PWM (Pulse Width Modulation) pin on the Arduino. This allows the Arduino to vary the duty cycle of the signal, effectively controlling the speed of Motor 2. Motor 1 speed control is not shown on this particular labelled image. Typically, it would be controlled through an Enable pin (ENA) and may need additional circuitry.\n    * **5V Connection:** The module also connects to the Arduino's 5V pin. This provides power for the logic circuits on the L298N driver.\n\nThe heat sink on the module is essential for dissipating heat generated during motor operation, especially at higher currents. The various ICs and capacitors on the board manage the logic and power regulation necessary for controlling the motors.  \n\nThis configuration allows for precise and independent control of two DC motors, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, such as robotics, automated vehicles, and other projects involving motorized movement.\n",

                    "Transcription": "hello everyone it's nishant from career right here and in today's video i'm gonna talk about new topic and the topic is basic code java interview questions and answers for freshers so without wasting time let's come to the concrete stuff now alright so let's begin with the first one what is java java is high level general purpose programming language created in 1995 by james gosling and is now owned by oracle java is one of the most popular language in the world and is secured fast and powerful it supports multi paradise such as object oriented functional imperative etc and has a huge community support behind it it is used to develop mobile application desktop applications web applications web servers games database connection and many more and runs on more than 3 billion devices around the world now coming to the next one how is java program executed a java program is written and saved in a java file known as a source code this source code is then passed to the compiler where it compiles into byte code now this bytecode cannot be directly executed by the machine the bytecode is translated into machine code first by the java virtual machine that is jbm and then executed by the machine now what is this jbm jbm is platform specific which means every platform has its own java virtual machine okay so moving on to the next one how is java platform independent the java programming language is platform independent which means the code can be written once and run anywhere and this is achieved because of java compiler that converts source code into byte code and this byte code is platform independent and can be executed on any platform through java virtual machine for example if a program is written and compiled on a windows platform the program's byte code is first be translated into machine code and then can be executed on any platform such as windows linux mac os through their java virtual machine now coming to the next one what are the various access specifiers in java excess specifiers define the scope or accessibility of the classes interfaces variables etc it defines how they can be accessed from other parts of the program and there are four access specifiers in java they are public private protected and default now coming to public now when defined as public the data items and functions are accessible from anywhere in the program next is private when defined as private they are only accessible from the class where they are defined now next is protected when defined as protected they are accessible from the classes that belong to the same package the subclass of the class and from within the class where they are defined now next is default and if you do not mention any specifier then by default the default access specifier is active which means they are accessible from all the classes that belong to the same package okay so coming to the next one what is a method in java a method is a block of code that performs a specific task methods are also called functions methods can also take input of the data in the form of parameters methods must be declared within a class and they are defined by the name of the method followed by a parenthesis there are methods which are already predefined such as system.out.printing and we can also define our own methods now here is an example of our own method now in this example you can see forward slashes which are comments which are ignored by the compiler but it is very useful for the user for better reliability of the code okay so let's try to understand what is java main method in a java program the main method is a method where the execution starts or it is the entry point of a java program hence it is one of the most important methods of java the java compiler or java virtual machine looks for the main method when it starts executing a java program now let's have an example of main method in a java program okay so the next one is what is string arguments that always appear on the java main method string array is used to declare a simple string array and argument is the name of the string array argument stores command line arguments that are supplied when executing a java program as an area of string objects and if we run our program from the command line and supply arguments such as then argument will contain string 1 and 2. hence it is necessary parameter for the main function and these parameters are absolutely necessary in main method in order for it to be treated as entry point of the java program alright so moving on to the next one what is a static method a method which is declared as static can be accessed directly by specifying its name it can be called without creating an object of class whereas a method declared as public without static can be accessed only by the creation of an object of the class static method belongs to the class and not to the object a static method doesn't require any object state so when you do not want to access instance variable you can call static methods without instantiating the object now let's have an example of static method so in this example we have a class called test and the test class we have two methods one is static method and other is normal method now come to the main method in the main method you can see we have called static method without creating object of the class test but in order to call a normal method we have created an object of class test and then called a normal method alright so moving on to the next one what is method overloading in method overloading multiple methods can have same name with different parameters method overloading can be achieved in two ways by changing the number of arguments and by changing the data type of arguments now let's have an example over here so in this example you can see we have two methods with same name but different type of arguments now the next question is can we overload the main method yes we can overload the main method we can have any number of main method now the question arises how does the compiler know which is the entry point into the program if there are multiple main methods the compiler will check for the parameters string argument in the main method and will recognize it as the entry point into the program jbm always calls the original main method it doesn't call the overloaded main method alright so coming to the next one what is a constructor in java a constructor in java is a special method that is used to initialize an object a constructor must have the same name as that of the class and doesn't have a return type and every time an object is created using the new keyword the default constructor is called now let's have an example of a constructor so in this example you can see the moment we create an object it will automatically call the constructor now coming to the next one how many types of constructors are used in java now based on arguments accepted by the constructor there are three types of constructors and the first one is no argument constructor a no argument constructor is a constructor that doesn't have any arguments or parameters the values are defined within the constructor itself next is parameterized constructor a parameterized constructor is a constructor that contains arguments or parameters next one is default constructor a default constructor is a constructor that is created by the compiler when we do not define any constructor in the program a default constructor must not be confused with a no argument constructor they are not the same in java okay so the next question is explain the difference between java constructor and java method a java constructor is a special method used to initialize an object whereas a method is a block of code that performs a certain task a constructor must not have a return type whereas a method can have a return type the constructor name must be same as that of class whereas the method name may or may not be same as that of class the constructor is invoked implicitly whereas a method is invoked explicitly now coming to the next one what is inheritance in java inheritance is a process where a class acquires attributes and methods of another class when we inherit the attributes and methods of an existing class we can access all the attributes and methods of that class in the program and this promotes code reasonability now the next question is what is subclass and superclass subclass is a class that inherits from another class and is also known as a child it is derived from super class and also inherits the properties of super class whereas superclass is a class that is being inherited from and it is also known as a paret it is a class from which many subclasses can be created the subclasses also inherit the properties of a super class let's have an example of these classes in this example bus car truck are all subclasses of the superclass vehicle now the next question is how is inheritance implemented in a java program in java to inherit from a class we use the extend keyword let's have an example of inheritance now in this example the class main can use all attributes and methods of the arithmetic class as if they were their own okay so coming to the next one what is a final variable a variable declared with the final keyword is a final variable and is used to prevent from overriding and modifying so we can say a final variable once assigned a value can never be changed so if we initialize a variable with the final keyword then we cannot modify its value and if we declare a method as final then it cannot be overridden by any subclasses now the next one is what is a package in java a package in java is used to group related classes or it is a collection of related classes packages are used to avoid name conflicts between classes and it allows to write a better maintainable code the next one is what are the different types of packages packages are divided into two categories built-in packages and user-defined packages now built-in packages are pre-written and are stored in the java api that are free to use they consist of packages for managing input output data programming and many more and here are some of the commonly used built-in packages next is user defined packages and these packages are created by the user now coming to the last question in this series what are abstract class an abstract class is a restricted class where we cannot create objects of the class to access the members of the abstract class it must be inherited to a subclass where we can then access the members of the abstract class through the object of the subclass an abstract class can have both regular methods and abstract methods without its body you ",
                    "Summary": "so the next question is explain the difference between java constructor and java method a java constructor is a special method used to initialize an object whereas a method is a block of code that performs a certain task a constructor must not have a return type whereas a method can have a return type the constructor name must be same as that of class whereas the

                    "Transcription": "hello welcome to our YouTube channel today we are taking one more interview as usual daily we are taking and this complete series is for interview questions and answers but always remember what I asked is for you don't judge candidates it's not your duty as is all I'm telling in every interview your duty is to judge yourself I'll be asking questions pause the interview pause the video and then try to answer by yourself and judge yourself and this will give you mock idea like how the interviews are happening in the companies and how you will be answering so without taking much time let's start today we have Silo with us and she's Engineering Graduate okay so welcome silu uh can you explain about yourself yes first of all thank you sir for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself I myself I have completed my be in computer engineering from RND server School engineering uh with the aggregate cgpa of 7.89 I've done my schooling and dwells from Maharashtra itself uh I'm coming to my technical skills um I know about core Java in that I know about oops Collections and oops Collections and coming and HTML CSS and JavaScript coming to my family we we are four members including need cells yes attaches how much you rate yourself out of one to ten how would you rate yourself out of 10 10 is highest one is lowest in Korea so I'll rate myself seven no problem it's good to say nine also then also provided if you have studied very hard okay and you are very perfect okay do not say lower than five okay that makes interviewer confidence down okay so he might not take interview so a good digit you selected that is seven right yes great no problem okay so let me start with some basic questions what are the access specifier available in Java there are four asset specifiers available in Java those are public protected private and default what is encapsulation encapsulation means we bind a Google specifier is called as an encapsulation for example you can take a capsule and that we uh we mixes a several medicines medicines in a one one capsule yeah so that is encapsulation okay so I'll mix all of them so what is SQL SQL is a structure query language this big query language is used to store the databases using relational database the relational database it is called as SQL in this data is defined by a particular commands and the commands we use in this are create alter and drop and coming to DML DML is a data manipulation language in this we manipulate the data by using three commands insert delete and update and coming to DCL DCL is a data control language uh in this we in this we uh we have two commands and we those commands are Grant and revoke okay great great that was very explanatory uh what is primary key so primary key it is a primary key is primary key is a minimal set of an attribute uh of a of a table uh if my primary when we use more more than we will use more than one or two primary Keys we need a we need a more space for that and the and primary key has a minimal value of 900 bytes okay I would expect in such questions uh important points you should be talking like primary key means unique values okay no problem uh what is difference between string string buffer and string Builder so such string is an immutable immutable class and string buffer answering Builder are notable class uh string string buffer is a synchronized and it is it is thread safe we can call two methods uh Simon we can call two methods simultaneously in string buffer um string buffer is less efficient than string Builder uh coming to string Builder and string Builder is a synchronized it is not thread safe we can we can we can we cannot haul uh two threads simultaneously in string Builder and it is more efficient than string buffer okay what is string Builder as a string Builder it is it is a synchronized data and it is not a it is not a thread save string Builder comes in jdk 1.5 okay after Java is become Advanced okay so that type string Builder came and it is more uh useful than this ring buffer okay so remember that correct oh not a problem next is like what is serialization uh so serialization it is a mechanism of writing a core uh when we write a code it from byte code it converts into object code and uh and it is and DC realization is opposite of the serialization uh in that the code is written in an object it converts to a byte form what is the difference between arraylist and has Set uh errorless errorless has a errorless has um okay it allows duplicate duplicate yeah analyst allows duplicate whereas asset doesn't allows duplicate and uh it it will uh analyze the errorless has um order is minted the in errorless the order is maintained whereas in asset uh has set order is not maintained which is uh good to use earliest or asset um no problem um what is difference between interface and abstract class interface and abstract class okay no problem what is final finally and finalize final is a keyword finally is also keyword finalizes the method okay final is um in final we finally is to define a constant finally is used in exception and finalized it is used in methods okay so before garbage collections run finalize method will get involved yes okay so you should remember this okay one question I ask I want to give answer for that so that many people are seeing this interview so it's not about only asking question but giving answers also difference between interface and abstract class so in interface we can have method public abstract but there is compulsory in interface method will not have body whereas in abstract class methods can have body and without body also compulsory access specifier of methods in interface should be public whereas in abstract class you can have any access specified so remember such small differences one or two differences that's enough okay yeah so we'll be preparing next time right yes so what is a method overriding it's a method overriding uh in when two or more parameters when two are more uh when two or more names are same but and they see and they also have the same parameter is called as overriding whereas overloading is when we have same name but different parameters is called as overloading and overloading is solved by using compile time polymorphism and overriding is solved by using uh runtime poly modules good so what is polymorphism actually it's polyformism means one one task and many forms a human a man can be as a father he acts as a father plays role as father a son and as a husband and same that person if he goes for a shop he plays a role as a customer okay great we understood this example okay next is um what what do you what do you uh advances I know about springboard and he burned it uh uh what is and the crude uh operations what is hibernate so hibernate is hibernate is is a uh when server uh request to the data data server and that data server again responds to the server is called as a fibernate okay so rather saying that hybrid is used for retrieving data or resetting data into the database okay but you're correct that's not a problem okay next is I have a question just a second what is spring boot so spring boot is a communication between client and server when a client requests to a server and that server responds to the client this process is known as a springboard you should talk very general okay it is called as spring boot no nothing like that there is no definitions uh for terms okay Springwood is not a term yeah we are getting like returns it is a concept is not a concept it's a framework okay so you should be talking in that way okay no problem okay next uh simple questions I have like can independent class oh yes sir class is an instant of an object uh it has its own Behavior Uh it has its own behavior data and all and it simply it is a same instance of that object okay and what is object object is a blueprint of a class what is blue green means uh blueprint means hello studying us I'm sick okay no problem so what what we understood from this whatever we speak we should be knowing a meaning right yeah blueprint is a fancy word okay but if you answer for that also it will be good but what definition you give is really good okay correct not a problem can I explain what is file input stream and file output stream yes sir file input stream uh in input stream we write the data uh to the particular destination uh for example if you want to go from one place to another so we write the data from for example from Pune to Mumbai that data is written in that destination and file output stream means we read the data of that particular information so I think you got confused input stream means reading okay input is reading yeah and output is writing so we'll remember okay so if this gets confused now you should be trying again and again for writing of these Concepts okay I know this will this concepts are getting confused to everyone yes okay but my guide is to everyone would be priority did you ever tried writing answers yes I tried I do basically that okay okay but that's good no problem what is abstraction uh abstractions abstraction means uh it it hides is the internal data and it shows the what is mean is shown to the user for example if we send if we are sending an SMS to SMS uh the SM the internal system is not seen just only the the delivery system is not seen only what the user wants wants it it is only sold what is super class of all the classes in Java object you know object class object class yes sir what is at override annotation uh so what is ADD override annotation override annotation uh sir override annotation means when if the one word is overwritten or for example if we uh we have written in the one word which is overwritten in the code that override at the red override annotation is written above that a line so that they oh so that the overall what is the runtime exception and compile time exception it compiles when the execution uh is done by using compiler and runtime means it it the execution it is the execution is done when x uh okay what's the use of catch block catch block it um foreign um no okay no problem I have two questions okay last questions maybe uh what do you know in collection framework what do you know just explain whatever you know in that trip sir it is a framework uh it is uh you till until a framework is used uh in that we use different uh like we use add and collection framework is used for storing a data data yeah okay connection we used for storing a data data uh collection framework has different classes a release has said hash map like that you can tell right yeah go ahead explain uh mm-hmm collection frame is used to store the data it has uh it has it has a sets like asset um errorless asset RLS hash map what is the difference between threaded process thread and processors so process is process means uh when we execute a program uh it doesn't run uh it doesn't run uh completely means it doesn't run uh what we say it doesn't run um I'm not even with that word it doesn't execute a completely before executing that it takes it it tooks all the execution steps what are all needed and then that execution is done this is known as process and the thread and coming to thread thread is a subset of process um in this in this all the in this uh one it is also called as thread when one or more threads are used simultaneously it is also called as lightweight process and thread has two types that is single thread and multi-thread single thread means when one one thread is uh called it is called a single Z when multiple threads are called simultaneously is called as multi thread great great okay next is like what is static keyword in Java uh static keyword uh it is it is a non-asset cell specifier modifier and internal variables uh which is you which is it is intermediate of a parent class okay what is inheritance inheritance um inheritance is when inheritance means um a child class is totally inheritant by a parent class is called as inheritance and there are four types of inheritance plus that is single level inheritance multi-level multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance okay so these are all about technology questions what are your hobbies okay so that's it that's all questions from my side but I have feedback for you yes okay and that feedback is for every fresher those who are start those who want to start their career in it okay that is more important right giving interview getting past failed is not important we improve gradually in that okay okay so good points about you are you have good communication uh confidence you have you have good dating to come on this platform okay a lot of things like you see you have that daring actually many people doesn't have that thing okay you are daring to talk in front of people that's really good some feedback you have for improvements okay and Improvement would be you should remember things okay you get you forget things easily I think so like uh access specified this exercise you've told correctly but many other things you forgot I don't know how much Writing Practice you are doing but that is a must okay try talking get try giving interviews to yourself no need to have mock interviews or give going to the organization and giving interview so I would suggest you stand in front of mirrors yes take every question take some list of questions you might get that on the Google okay from Google take some interview questions list speak that question and try to answer that question in front of mirror okay you should talk to yourself you should help yourself that always I'm telling you're getting my point yes many things many times we feel that we know the answers yes and these Treasures are doing this mistake but when you sit in front of interviewer many times you forget that right that is improved right so I would expect you to talk to yourself give mock interviews as much as possible very well learning in any Institute that doesn't matter but you should be giving mock interviews studying it okay I'm not saying that uh a lot of hard work needed to do things but I will expect smart work is needed okay how was your experience what do you understood this is the first mock interview you are given never ever yeah this is my first mock interview and what was your feeling this was a good experience right now I have I will overcome whatever my mistakes are that I'll do best in next interview also yeah and don't see it's a mistake it's just some improvements yeah okay there is nothing like a mistake or something okay but thank you thank you thank you for your time also okay thank you thank you so this was a silo right yes sir yeah this is uh I asked many questions and again and again I'm telling you what questions I asked that matters and you might have seen freshers how they get confused on the questions because there are a lot of concept and you are very new to the concepts but interviewer needs answers and I hope this interview will be eye-opener for you all guys uh how confidence you need to build how communication you need everything I explained in this interview can it also give a lot of answers a lot of good answers you might have received some answers might be not that up to the mark but that doesn't matter to you as it's not your business your business is to understand yourself your business is to no answers to yourself what questions I'm asking you should be trying to give answers and build confidence if you want to give uh interview with me fill in the form and description that is mentioned in description like it share it I'll come back again with some other different interview thank you ",
                    "Summary": "yeah go ahead explain uh mm-hmm collection frame is used to store the data it has uh it has it has a sets like asset um errorless asset RLS hash map what is the difference between threaded process thread and processors so process is process means uh when we execute a program uh it doesn't run uh it doesn't run uh completely means it doesn't run uh what we say

serialization uh so serialization it is a mechanism of writing a core uh when we write a code it from byte code it converts into object code and uh and it is and DC realization is opposite of the serialization uh in that the code is written in an object it converts to a byte form what is the difference between arraylist and has Set uh errorless errorless has a errorless uh uh what is and the crude uh operations what is hibernate so hibernate is hibernate is is a uh when server uh request to the data data server and that data server again responds to the server is called as a fibernate safe we can call two methods uh Simon we can call two methods simultaneously in string buffer um string buffer is less efficient than string Builder uh coming to string Builder and string Builder is a synchronized it is not thread safe we can we can we can we cannot haul uh two threads simultaneously in string Builder and it is more efficient than string buffer okay no problem uh what is difference between string string buffer and string Builder so such string is an immutable immutable class and string buffer answering Builder are notable class uh string string buffer is a synchronized no problem what is abstraction uh abstractions abstraction means uh it it hides is the internal data and it shows the what is mean is shown to the user for example if we send if we are sending an SMS to SMS uh the SM the internal system is not seen just only the the delivery system is not seen only what the user wants wants it it is only sold what is super class of all the classes in Java object you know object class object class okay next is like what is static keyword in Java uh static keyword uh it is it is a non-asset cell specifier modifier and internal variables uh which is you which is it is intermediate of a parent class what is at override annotation uh so what is ADD override annotation override annotation uh sir override annotation means when if the one word is overwritten or for example if we uh we have written in the one word which is overwritten in the code that override at the red override annotation is written above that a line so that they yes sir file input stream uh in input stream we write the data uh to the particular destination uh for example if you want to go from one place to another we uh we have two commands and we those commands are Grant and revoke okay great great that was very explanatory uh what is primary key so primary key so what is SQL SQL is a structure query language this big query language is used to store the databases using relational database the relational database it is called as SQL in this data is defined by a particular commands and the commands we use in this are create alter and drop and coming to DML DML is a data manipulation language in this we manipulate the data by using three commands insert delete and update and coming to DCL DCL is a data control language uh in this we in this okay what is inheritance inheritance um inheritance is when inheritance means um a child class is totally inheritant by a parent class is called as inheritance and there are four types of inheritance plus that is single level inheritance multi-level multiple inheritance and hierarchical inheritance okay so let me start with some basic questions what are the access specifier available in Java there are four asset specifiers available in Java those are public protected private and default what is encapsulation encapsulation means we bind a Google specifier is called as an encapsulation for example you can take a capsule and that we uh we mixes a several medicines medicines in a one one capsule it is a primary key is primary key is a minimal set of an attribute uh of a of a table uh if my primary when we use more more than we will use more than one or two primary Keys we need a we need a more space for that and the and primary key has a minimal value of 900 bytes I myself I have completed my be in computer engineering from RND server School engineering uh with the aggregate cgpa of 7.89 I've done my schooling and dwells from Maharashtra itself uh I'm coming to my technical skills um I know about core Java in that I know about oops Collections and oops Collections and coming and HTML CSS and JavaScript coming to my family okay connection we used for storing a data data uh collection framework has different classes a release has said hash map like that you can tell right okay no problem what is final finally and finalize final is a keyword finally is also keyword finalizes the method okay final is um in final we finally is to define a constant finally is used in exception and finalized it is used in methods so we write the data from for example from Pune to Mumbai that data is written in that destination and file output stream means we read the data of that particular information so I think you got confused input stream means reading okay input is reading hello welcome to our YouTube channel today we are taking one more interview as usual daily we are taking and this complete series is for interview questions and answers but always remember what I asked is for you don't judge candidates it's not your duty as is all I'm telling in every interview your duty is to judge yourself I'll be asking questions pause the interview pause the video and then try to answer by yourself and judge yourself and this will give you mock idea like how the interviews are happening in the companies and how you will be answering so without taking much time let's start today we have Silo with us and she's Engineering Graduate okay I would expect in such questions uh important points you should be talking like primary key means unique values okay you get you forget things easily I think so like uh access specified this exercise you've told correctly but many other things you forgot I don't know how much Writing Practice you are doing okay so good points about you are you have good communication uh confidence you have you have good dating to come on this platform okay next uh simple questions I have like can independent class yes so what is a method overriding it's a method overriding uh in when two or more parameters when two are more uh when two or more names are same okay it is called as spring boot no nothing like that there is no definitions uh for terms uh okay what's the use of catch block catch block it um foreign so you should remember this okay one question I ask I want to give answer for that so that many people are seeing this interview so it's not about only asking question but giving answers also difference between interface and abstract class yes take every question take some list of questions you might get that on the Google okay from Google take some interview questions list speak that question and try to answer that question in front of mirror and they also have the same parameter is called as overriding whereas overloading is when we have same name but different parameters is called as overloading and overloading is solved by using compile time polymorphism and overriding is solved by using uh runtime poly modules good okay next is um what what do you what do you uh advances and what is object object is a blueprint of a class what is blue green means uh blueprint means hello studying us okay do not say lower than five okay that makes interviewer confidence down but that is a must okay try talking get try giving interviews to yourself no need to have mock interviews or give going to the organization and giving interview oh yes sir class is an instant of an object uh it has its own Behavior oh so that the overall what is the runtime exception and compile time exception it compiles when the execution uh is done by using compiler and runtime means it it the execution okay so rather saying that hybrid is used for retrieving data or resetting data into the database but there is compulsory in interface method will not have body whereas in abstract class methods can have body and without body also compulsory access specifier of methods in interface should be public whereas in abstract class you can have any access specified so remember such small differences one or two differences that's enough okay that is more important right giving interview getting past failed is not important we improve gradually in that so that type string Builder came and it is more uh useful than this ring buffer okay a lot of things like you see you have that daring actually many people doesn't have that thing Uh it has its own behavior data and all I'm not saying that uh a lot of hard work needed to do things okay how was your experience what do you understood this is the first mock interview you are given never ever yeah and output is writing so we'll remember okay okay you are daring to talk in front of people that's really good some feedback okay I know this will this concepts are getting confused to everyone okay there is nothing like a mistake or something okay so before garbage collections run finalize method will get involved so welcome silu uh can you explain about yourself yes okay okay great we understood this example okay correct not a problem yes okay um no okay yes okay okay thank you thank you okay you should talk to yourself you should help yourself that always I'm telling you're getting my point okay no problem",

                    "Transcription": "This opinion article proposes a workflow for automated, precise drone seeding to improve forest restoration efforts.  Current drone seeding practices, adapted from agriculture, employ blanket seeding, which is inefficient and yields low establishment success due to seeds landing in unsuitable microsites. The authors argue for a precision approach, targeting specific, advantageous microsites at a submeter scale.  This approach reduces seed waste, lowers costs, improves seedling establishment, and allows for scalability.\n\nThe proposed workflow involves five key steps:\n\n1. **Target Microsite Selection:** Based on ecological knowledge, specific microsites offering benefits for seedling recruitment are selected. These could include locations near nurse plants, within protective structures like fallen branches, or in microtopographic features such as pits and mounds.  These locations offer advantages like improved microclimate, protection from herbivores, or enhanced resource access.\n\n2. **High-Resolution Imagery Acquisition:** Georeferenced, high-resolution imagery (submeter scale) is acquired from sources like satellites or UAVs.  This imagery allows for precise visual identification of the chosen microsites.\n\n3. **Annotated Training Dataset Creation:**  The acquired imagery is manually annotated to identify and mark the target microsites. This dataset trains the AI model to recognize these locations automatically.  Field validation of the annotated data is recommended.\n\n4. **AI Model Training:** A deep learning model (e.g., Faster R-CNN, Mask R-CNN) is trained using the annotated dataset to automatically detect the targeted microsites in new images. Transfer learning techniques and potentially multi- or hyperspectral imagery can further enhance model accuracy. Publicly accessible libraries of trained AI models are advocated for global scalability and accessibility.\n\n5. **Coordinate Transfer and Drone Seeding:** The coordinates of the microsites identified by the AI are transferred to the drone equipped with RTK technology and a precision dispenser.  The drone then executes a targeted seeding mission, delivering seeds only to these pre-selected locations.\n\nThe article highlights several examples of this approach in practice:\n\n* **Nurse plants:** Utilizing existing shrubs as microsites can improve microclimatic conditions and offer protection from herbivores.\n* **Biological legacies:** Piles of branches or dead trees left after disturbances can act as nurse structures.\n* **Pits and mounds:** Microtopographic variations created by fallen trees offer beneficial conditions for seedling establishment.\n\nThe authors emphasize the potential for this method to be applied beyond forest restoration to various ecosystems and plant species, provided suitable microsites can be identified.  They highlight the need for openly accessible AI libraries to ensure equitable application of this technology worldwide.  By combining ecological knowledge with advanced technology, this precision drone seeding workflow aims to significantly increase the efficiency and success of restoration efforts globally.\n",
